## Purpose of the projects:

During Oceanhackweek we will be facilitating open hacking sessions most of the afternoons. The purpose of these sessions is for you to gain hands-on experience in working together on a well-defined problem related to oceanographic sciences.

## What is hacking?

Hacking is a session of focused, highly collaborative computer programming, in which we create conditions for rapid absorption of new ideas and methods. Visit our [hacking central](Hacking-Central) page for more specific information on this approach.

## Why is this important?

Increasingly, research and software development is being conducted across groups of people with diverse skills and backgrounds. We believe this collaborative work leads to more innovative solutions to complex problems. At oceanhackweek, our goal is to explore with you some of the skills needed to navigate technical and social challenges of working in these kinds of collaborative settings.

## How will the projects be conducted?

* On day 1 we will facilitate the sharing of ideas and formation of people into small teams (2-5 people)
* Once formed, each team will be guided through exercises to help narrow in on a set of tasks that are doable within the 5 days. A brief project outline will be posted to GitHub, following the "Project Guidelines" below.

## What can I do to prepare in advance?

* If you have a project idea already brewing, we encourage you to share that with the team on our general Slack channel. We can add additional channels as the project ideas develop.
* Feel free to explore various projects and initiate conversations. The goal is to gather as much information as you can to inform your decision about which team to join when we meet in person.
* Contact an oceanhack organizer if you would like assistance in assessing whether a project is well-scoped, or if you need help with a particular dataset.

# Project guidelines

Each project requires a brief project summary in the readme.md of each GitHub project folder. Below is a template for the project summary.

#### Project Title

Brief title describing the proposed work.

#### Collaborators on this project

List all participants on the project.

#### The problem

What oceanographic data science problem are you going to explore? Try to focus on the data science/methodology problem first, followed by the location-specific oceanographic example afterwards. The project is likely more engaging for fellow hackers if it is centered around common data science problems. For example, the project could be to develop a workflow in Python to analyze CTD time series from multiple data sources, instead of emphasizing and focusing only on temperature variations in one very specific part of the ocean.

#### Application Example

Here is where you follow up with a location-specific example of where the data science methodology applies and list example datasets (size, format, how to access) that could be used for this exploration.

#### Specific Tasks

List the specific tasks you want to accomplish.

#### Existing methods

How would you or others traditionally try to address this problem?

#### Proposed methods/tools

Building from what you learn at oceanhackweek, what new approaches would you like to try to implement?

#### Background reading

Optional: links to manuscripts or technical documents for more in-depth analysis.

# Project Ideas
* Developing tutorials for using NASA data on the cloud.
* Working on an efficient open source matchup tutorial for satellite orbital data and in situ point or trajectory data.
* Developing an OSS algorithm development toolbox in Python to deal with a 400GB AMSR brightness temperature - in situ matchup database.
* [Argovis - a visualualization and API for accessing Argo data](https://argovis.colorado.edu/ng/home)
* [OHW18 Projects](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/projects.html)
