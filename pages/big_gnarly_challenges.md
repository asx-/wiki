**What big gnarly challenge would you like to see us tap the mad skills in this room to make progress on this week?**
(Group discussion outcome)

- Biological data broad scale availability → need global access to data sets and put data in standardized format
- Data parasite challenge → if you use someone else’s data to make discovery
- Automatic QC of data with machine learning → there are a lot of data that no one has looked at, maybe we can create machine models that can help us QC the uninspected data → what does good look like, how do you quantify that?
- Data calibration → some require disciplinary scientists to calibrate, making sure not serving data that are not applicable to the problems
- How can we use data in an interactive way for them to understand and interpret the data to inform the public/educators to use the data that have been collected
- How to make discoveries in large multi-instrument data streams, finding relationship between data
- Mixing data sets, and also dealing with the statistics
- Looking at multiple data sets to make sure data match up and make sense (CTD instruments from different instruments in the same area)
- Finding metadata for open data sets, make sure people know how different data are collected: it’s for all data sets
- ML and NN models to supplement physics-based models, making things more accessible and make connections to data that are available
- There are many data repositories, but is there modules that can help “translate” from different data systems/instruments and integrating multiple streams
- Change detection vs internal variability, how to find in big data sets
- Cultural changes/institutional structural change
- Building community and build tools and keep them sustainable; how do we make sure that hackweek outcomes get continued
- How to deal with legacy data sets, how to make them up to current standard; annotation of data sets; use data to make predictions
- How do you relate data collected from new technology to old data
