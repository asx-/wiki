## What is a Hack?

A "hack" is a small project that aims to solve a specific problem using computational tools.

Examples of hacks include:
* Building a working demo of a new or modified algorithm
* An outline of a larger project, with some key features scoped
* Visualization of an old dataset in a new manner
* A modified algorithm applied to a new dataset
* A mash-up of two pre-existing pieces of code to perform some new function
* Creating a tool to apply to work with existing code, datasets


## Pro-Tips

* Start with ideas that are close to home: your research, a project for your company, something you have always been interested in.
* Reach out to [fellow hackers](participants) in the hackweek: Hacking is a community activity!
* Start with one simple idea first, and when it is built add complexity afterwards
* Help your neighbor: you might be the person they need to solve their problem, and vice versa
* When discussing, pitch your explanation to the least experienced hacker in the group, and you'll end up better understanding what you're trying to do


## Getting Started

* Who are you going to hack with? Here's [a list of your fellow hackers](participants)
* What are you going to work on? [Project guidelines and ideas](project_guidelines)
* Start pitching ideas on our #projects slack channel, and then once projects materialize, we can migrate to a separate project channel
* Begin populating a oceanhackweek GitHub project page - instructions coming soon
