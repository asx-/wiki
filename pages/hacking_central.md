# What is a Hack?

A "hack" is a small project that aims to solve a specific problem using computational tools.

Examples of hacks include:
* a working demo of a new or modified algorithm
* an outline of a larger project, with some key features scoped
* a new visualization of an old dataset
* a modified algorithm applied to a new dataset
* a mash-up of two pre-existing pieces of code to perform some new function

# Pro-Tips

* Start with ideas that are close to home: your graduate work, a project for your company, something you have always been interested in.
* reach out to other participants: Hacking is a community activity!
* start with the simplest things first, and add complexity later
* Help your neighbor: you might be the person they need to solve their problem, and vice versa
* When discussing, pitch your explanation to the least experienced hacker in the group, and you'll end up better understanding what you're trying to do

## Getting Started

* Who are you going to hack with? Here's [the list of your fellow hackers](Participants)
* What are you going to work on?
* Start pitching ideas on our #projects slack channel, and then once projects materialize, we can migrate to a separate project channel
* Begin populating a oceanhackweek GitHub project page
