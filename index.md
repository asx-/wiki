## What is a hackweek?

The hackweek model has emerged within the data science community as a powerful tool for fostering exchange of ideas in research and computation by providing training in modern data analysis workflows. In contrast to conventional academic conferences or workshops, hackweeks are intensive and interactive, facilitated by three core components: tutorials on state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning, and on-site project work in a collaborative environment. This setup is particularly powerful for sciences that require not only domain-specific knowledge, but also effective computational workflows to foster rapid exchange of ideas and make discovery, as has been shown by the success of the previous Astro-, Neuro-, and Geohackweeks. This is an excellent match with the nature of oceanographic research where data are large and complex and the community is diverse and collaborative.

### Quick Info
- Oceanhackweek will happen in the **Odegaard Active Learning Center, Room 136**.
- **Doors open at 9:00 am** each morning (Monday-Friday).
- Due to space limitations, only registered Oceanhackweek participants will be allowed to attend the tutorials and open working sessions.
- **Participants are expected to attend all scheduled Oceanhackweek activities.** Contact an organizer if any circumstances prevent you from attending.

### Food
- **All meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) are provided for all days**. 
- Breakfast and dinner will be provided through meal cards, in which you can purchase on campus food. 
- Lunch will be catered and held at the [eScience Institute](https://goo.gl/maps/5H5xF2nFjFU2) each day.
- Coffee breaks will be provided each day.

### Internet access and communication
- For information on wireless access, you can either use Eduroam, if it’s available to you, or we’ll give you guest access to the UW network on the first day.
